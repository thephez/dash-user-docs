Wallets
*******

A Dash <> can refer to either a wallet program or a wallet file. Wallet
programs create <> to receive <> and use the corresponding <> to spend
those duffs. Wallet files store private keys and (optionally) other
information related to <> for the wallet program.

Wallet programs and wallet files are addressed below in separate
subsections, and this document attempts to always make it clear whether
weâ€™re talking about wallet programs or wallet files.
