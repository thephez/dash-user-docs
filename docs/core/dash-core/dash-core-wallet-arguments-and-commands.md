# Arguments and Commands

## Overview

All command-line options (except for `-conf`) may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file. The configuration file is a list of `<setting>=<value>` pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the `#` character.

The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, dash-qt (or dashd) will look for a file named `dash.conf` in the Dash data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the `-datadir` and `-conf` command-line arguments.

| Platform | Path to data folder | Typical path to configuration file |
| - | - | - |
| Linux | ~/ | /home/username/.dashcore/dash.conf |
| macOS | ~/Library/Application Support/ | /Users/username/Library/Application Support/DashCore/dash.conf |
| Windows | %APPDATA% | _(Vista-10)_ C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\DashCore\\dash.conf |
| Windows | %APPDATA% | _(2000-XP)_ C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\DashCore\\dash.conf |

> 📘 Testnet/Devnet modes
>
> Note: if running Dash in testnet mode, the sub-folder `testnet3` will be appended to the data directory automatically. Likewise, if running in devnet mode, the subfolder `devnet-"devnet name"` will be appended to the data directory.
