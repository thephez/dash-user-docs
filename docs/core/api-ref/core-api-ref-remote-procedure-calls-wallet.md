## AbandonTransaction

*Added in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0*

The [`abandontransaction` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#abandontransaction) marks an in-wallet transaction and all its in-wallet descendants as abandoned. This allows their inputs to be respent.

*Parameter #1---a transaction identifier (TXID)*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
TXID | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The TXID of the transaction that you want to abandon.  The TXID must be encoded as hex in RPC byte order

*Result---`null` on success*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | JSON `null` when the transaction and all descendants were abandoned

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Abandons the transaction on your node.

```bash
dash-cli abandontransaction fa3970c341c9f5de6ab13f128cbfec58d732e736a505fe32137ad551c799ecc4
```

Result (no output from `dash-cli` because result is set to `null`).

*See also*

* [SendRawTransaction](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-raw-transactions#sendrawtransaction): validates a transaction and broadcasts it to the peer-to-peer network.

The [`encryptwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#encryptwallet) encrypts the wallet with a passphrase.  This is only to enable encryption for the first time. After encryption is enabled, you will need to enter the passphrase to use private keys.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "**Warning:** if using this RPC on the command line, remember that your shell probably saves your command lines (including the value of the passphrase parameter). In addition, there is no RPC to completely disable encryption. If you want to return to an unencrypted wallet, you must create a new wallet and restore your data from a backup made with the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#dumpwallet)."
}

Result:

```text
Wallet encrypted; Dash Core server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet.
The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using
HD). You need to make a new backup.

```

*See also*

* [WalletPassphrase](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#walletpassphrase): stores the wallet decryption key in memory for the indicated number of seconds. Issuing the `walletpassphrase` command while the wallet is already unlocked will set a new unlock time that overrides the old one.
* [WalletLock](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#walletlock): removes the wallet encryption key from memory, locking the wallet. After calling this method, you will need to call `walletpassphrase` again before being able to call any methods which require the wallet to be unlocked.
* [WalletPassphraseChange](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#walletpassphrasechange): changes the wallet passphrase from 'old passphrase' to 'new passphrase'.

## GetBalance
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "Requires <<glossary:wallet>> support (**unavailable on masternodes**)."
}
[/block]

The [`getbalance` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#getbalance) gets the total _available balance_ in Dash. The _available balance_ is what the wallet considers currently spendable, and is thus affected by options which limit spendability such as `-spendzeroconfchange`.

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Confirmations | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The minimum number of confirmations an externally-generated transaction must have before it is counted towards the balance.  Transactions generated by this node are counted immediately.  Typically, externally-generated transactions are payments to this wallet and transactions generated by this node are payments to other wallets.  Use `0` to count unconfirmed transactions.  Default is `1`

*Parameter #3---whether to add the balance from transactions locked via InstantSend*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
addlocked | bool | Optional<br>(exactly 1) | Add the balance from InstantSend locked transactions

```

Get the balance, including transactions with at least three confirmations and those spent to watch-only addresses. Include the balance from InstantSend locked transactions.

```bash
dash-cli -testnet getbalance "" 3 true true
```

Result:

```json
1.00000000
```

## GetNewAddress
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "Requires <<glossary:wallet>> support (**unavailable on masternodes**)."
}
[/block]

The [`getnewaddress` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#getnewaddress) returns a new Dash address for receiving payments. If `label` is specified, the address is added to the address book so payments received with the address will be associated with `label`.

*Parameter #1---an account name*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`label` | string | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The label name for the address to be linked to. If not provided, the default label `""` is used. It can also be set to the empty string `""` to represent the default label. The label does not need to exist, it will be created if there is no label by the given name.

*Result---a dash address never previously returned*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The new Dash address.  

*Example from Dash Core 0.17.0*

Create a new address in the "doc test" account:

```bash
dash-cli -testnet getnewaddress "doc test"
```

Result:

```text

```

*See also*

* [GetAccountAddress](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet-deprecated#getaccountaddress): returns the current Dash address for receiving payments to this account. If the account doesn't exist, it creates both the account and a new address for receiving payment.  Once a payment has been received to an address, future calls to this RPC for the same account will return a different address.
* [GetRawChangeAddress](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#getrawchangeaddress): returns a new Dash address for receiving change. This is for use with raw transactions, not normal use.
* [GetBalance](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#getbalance): gets the balance in decimal dash across all accounts or for a particular account.

*Parameters: none*

*Result---a P2PKH address which can be used in raw transactions*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | A P2PKH address which has not previously been returned by this RPC.  The address will be removed from the keypool but not marked as a receiving address, so RPCs such as the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#dumpwallet) will show it as a change address.  The address may already have been part of the keypool, so other RPCs such as the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#dumpwallet) may have disclosed it previously.  If the wallet is unlocked, its keypool will also be filled to its max (by default, 100 unused keys).  If the wallet is locked and its keypool is empty, this RPC will fail

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

```bash
dash-cli -testnet getrawchangeaddress
```

Result:

```text
yXBr9BiJmugTzHPgByDmvjJMAkvhTmXVJ8
```

*See also*

* [GetNewAddress](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#getnewaddress): returns a new Dash address for receiving payments. If an account is specified, payments received with the address will be credited to that account.
* [GetAccountAddress](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet-deprecated#getaccountaddress): returns the current Dash address for receiving payments to this account. If the account doesn't exist, it creates both the account and a new address for receiving payment.  Once a payment has been received to an address, future calls to this RPC for the same account will return a different address.

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Lock two outputs:

```bash
dash-cli -testnet lockunspent false '''
  [
    {
