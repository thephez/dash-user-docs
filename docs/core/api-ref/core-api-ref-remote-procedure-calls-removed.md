`genkey` | Generates a base64 encoded 256 bit AES key that can be used for the communication with KeePassHttp. This is only necessary for manual configuration.
`init` | Sets up the association between Dash Core and KeePass by generating an AES key and sending an association message to KeePassHttp. This will trigger KeePass to ask for an Id for the association. Returns the association and the base64 encoded string for the AES key.
`setpassphrase` | Updates the passphrase in KeePassHttp to a new value. This should match the passphrase you intend to use for the wallet. Please note that the standard RPC commands walletpassphrasechange and the wallet encryption from the QT GUI already send the updates to KeePassHttp, so this is only necessary for manual manipulation of the password.

`result` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The TXID of the sent transaction, encoded as hex in RPC byte order

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

## Generate

>❗️
>
> **Warning:** **_Removed in Dash Core 18.1.0_**

The `generate` RPC mines blocks immediately (before the RPC call returns).

*Parameter #1---the number of blocks to generate*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`numblocks` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of blocks to generate.  The RPC call will not return until all blocks have been generated.

*Parameter #2---the number of iterations*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`maxtries` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of iterations to try (default = 1000000).

*Result---the generated block header hashes*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array containing the block header hashes of the generated blocks (may be empty if used with `generate 0`)
→<br>Header Hashes | string (hex) | Required<br>(1 or more) | The hashes of the headers of the blocks generated in regtest mode, as hex in RPC byte order

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Using regtest mode, generate 2 blocks:

```bash
dash-cli -regtest generate 2
```

Result:

```json
