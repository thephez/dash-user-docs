Overview
========

Testnet is the Dash testing network used for experimentation and
evaluation of Dash Core and Dash Platform features.

   ðŸš§ Testnet Stability

   As a testing network, Testnet may be subject to occasional updates
   and changes that break backwards compatibility. Please visit `this
   page <https://dash-testnet.freshstatus.io/>`__ to see current testnet
   status.

Network Details
===============

Infrastructure
--------------

Dash Core Group provides the core Testnet infrastructure consisting of
150 masternodes running Dash Core along with the platform services that
provide the `decentralized API (DAPI) <explanation-dapi>`__ and `storage
(Drive) <explanation-drive>`__ functionality.

Testnet also includes a `block
explorer <https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/>`__ for the core
blockchain and a `test Dash faucet <https://testnet-faucet.dash.org/>`__
that dispenses funds to users/developers experimenting on the network.

Features
--------

The Dash Platform features available on testnet include:

-  `Dash Platform Name Service <explanation-dpns>`__ (DPNS): a data
   contract and supporting logic for name registration
-  `Identities <explanation-identity>`__: creation of identities
-  `Names <explanation-dpns>`__: creation of DPNS names that link to an
   identity
-  `Data Contracts <doc:explanation-platform-protocol-data-contract>`__:
   creation of data contracts
-  `Documents <doc:explanation-platform-protocol-document>`__: used to
   store/update/delete data associated with data contracts
-  `DashPay <explanation-dashpay>`__: a data contract enableing a
   decentralized application that creates bidirectional direct
   settlement payment channels between identities and supports contact
   (name) based payments

Getting involved
