Introduction
============

The tutorials in this section walk through the steps necessary to begin
building on Dash Platform using the Dash JavaScript SDK. As all
communication happens via the masternode hosted decentralized API
(DAPI), you can begin using Dash Platform immediately without running a
local blockchain node.

Building on Dash Platform requires first registering an Identity and
then registering a Data Contract describing the schema of data to be
stored. Once that is done, data can be stored and updated by submitting
Documents that comply with the Data Contract.

   📘Tutorial code

   You can clone a repository containing the code for all tutorials from
   GitHub or download it as a `zip
   file <https://github.com/dashevo/platform-readme-tutorials/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`__.

Prerequisites
=============

The tutorials in this section are written in JavaScript and use
`Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/about/>`__. The following prerequisites
are necessary to complete the tutorials:

-  `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ (v12+)
-  Familiarity with JavaScript asynchronous functions using
   `async/await <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await>`__
-  The Dash JavaScript SDK (see `Connecting to a
   Network <tutorial-connecting-to-testnet#1-install-the-dash-sdk>`__)

through each tutorial is advantageous, the subset of tutorials listed
below get you from a start to storing data on Dash Platform most
quickly: - `Obtaining test funds <tutorial-create-and-fund-a-wallet>`__
